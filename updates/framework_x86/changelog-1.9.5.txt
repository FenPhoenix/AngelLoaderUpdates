Fixes:
 - Play Time was being displayed incorrectly when greater than 24 hours.
 - The Screenshots tab will no longer reset the selected screenshot to the latest one right before playing an FM.
 - Scanner was sometimes scanning script readmes when it should have ignored them entirely and scanned FM-related readmes only.
 - Fixed tab order in Settings -> Appearance.

Scanner/rtf:
 - Relaxed rtf header detection slightly - now matches the RichTextBox internal behavior.
 - Rtf parser can now handle arbitrary number of nested groups.
 - Improved rtf parser performance.
 - Various small accuracy improvements in rtf parser.
 - Scanner now converts non-ASCII dashes and quotes (smart quotes etc.) to ASCII equivalents, so as not to trip up search filtering.
