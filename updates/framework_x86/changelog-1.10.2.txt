General:
 - Added support for Sneaky Upgrade 1.1.12.
 - Language files are now re-read whenever the Settings window is opened, allowing new ones to be added without restarting the app. This also improves startup time when many languages are installed.

Fixes:
 - For The Dark Mod 2.13, Training Mission authors are now detected again.
 - Fixed Dark Mod screenshot list auto-refresh was broken when screenshots directory didn't yet exist and then was created by the first screenshot being taken.
